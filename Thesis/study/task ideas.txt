Broken sorting algorithm
	Given:
	- Unsorted List/Array of Colors (maybe just grayscale), they should be sorted by brightness.
	- Algorithm to sort by brightness, e.g. some kind of insertion sort.
	Problem:
	- Idea: Objects duplicated/eliminated after sorting
	- Idea: Objects wrongly sorted
	(maybe as test failure)
	Task:
	- Find the problem and eliminate it.

Broken serialization
	Given:
	- Some realistic user-made data type, e.g. Contact.java
	- Serializing/desiralizing util as black box
	Problem:
	- Test fail: assertEquals(before, after)
	Task:
	- Find out what's wrongly (de-)serialized

Image matrix
	Given:
	- Some image, represented as X*Y*3 array (of int)
	- Algorithm for seam carving, which is under construction and only marks a possible seam
	by putting its pixel's values to black (0 0 0)
	Problem:
	- Graphical output is not yet implemented, but developers need some "feedback" while developing the algorithm
	Taks:
	- What does the algorithm compute, does it make any sense?

Matrix diagonalization
	Given:
	- Algorithm to diagonalize matrices in order to compute their eigenvalues
	Problem:
	- The algorithm does not halt
	Task:
	- Watch the process of diagonalization and see when it should halt

Number table (point alignment)
	Given:
