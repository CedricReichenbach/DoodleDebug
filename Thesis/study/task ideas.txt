Broken sorting algorithm
	Given:
	- Unsorted List/Array of Colors (maybe just grayscale), they should be sorted by brightness.
	- Algorithm to sort by brightness, e.g. some kind of insertion sort.
	Problem:
	- Idea: Objects duplicated/eliminated after sorting
	- Idea: Objects wrongly sorted
	(maybe as test failure)
	Task:
	- Find the problem and eliminate it.

Broken serialization
	Given:
	- Some realistic user-made data type, e.g. Contact.java
	- Serializing/desiralizing util as black box
	Problem:
	- Test fail: assertEquals(before, after)
	Task:
	- Find out what's wrongly (de-)serialized
