- Should RenderingPlugins be typified or not? Atm, objects are always casted there, because Renderings are typified.

- Should the output be always cleared at the beginning of a run or not?
	Guess it should

- User program seems not to terminate when using DoodleDebug
	Probably because client thread remains ready for sending stuff

- IE: box-shadow inside border -> nasty space at bottom (because box-shadow is inside border)

- DD has veery long to render a int[200][120][3] (see study usecase "c_matrix")

- Stop server always before starting it (for when last shutdown was not correct)
