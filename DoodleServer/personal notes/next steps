	-> http://www.coderanch.com/t/383648/java/java/java-reflection-element-type-List

- Maybe break down tutorial into tutorial & documentation

- probably use local Roboto font file as fallback

- Enable beta info on beta version online

- ClassRendering: Show scope of inner classes too, e.g. similar rendering to fields/methods

- Class rendering: Interfaces? Icon of static members? Constructors?

- Test in multiple simultaneous instances (not while developing but with jar)

- Print Types when output generated through Doodleable interface as well?
