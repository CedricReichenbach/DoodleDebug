- Should RenderingPlugins be typified or not? Atm, objects are always casted there, because Renderings are typified.

- Should the output be always cleared at the beginning of a run or not?

- Not thread-save..?
	- Sometimes parts of css not loaded.
	- Lightbox-clicks at wrong time could cause strange behaviour (Doodler.render...())
	-> Race conditions! Problems only with first renderings

- User program seems not to terminate when using DoodleDebug

- IE: box-shadow inside border -> nasty space at bottom (because box-shadow is inside border)

- @font-face does not really work -.-
	-> try bundleresource: link inside eclipse (-> not working)
