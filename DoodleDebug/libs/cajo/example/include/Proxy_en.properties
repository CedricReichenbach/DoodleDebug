# This is the English language string table.
# A British translation would go in Proxy_en_GB.properties,
# It only the changed properties would need to be included,
# Since this file would be referenced for any missing tags.
# A French translation would go in Proxy_fr.properties
# A French Canadian translation would go in Proxy_fr_CA.properties
# The 2 letter country abbreviations are defined in java.util.Locale
# A default string table could be defined as Proxy.properties,
# that file would be used when no matching language tag could be found,
# Otherwise a java.util.MissingResourceException will be thrown.
