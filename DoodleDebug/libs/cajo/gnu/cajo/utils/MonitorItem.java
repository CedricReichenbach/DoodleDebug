/**
 * This class is used to instrument an object for invocation logging
 * purposes. It is intended as a replacement for standard RMI logging, in that
 * this logger is aware of the Invoke package methodology, and can decode it
 * properly.  Specifically, it will gather information about the calling
 * client, the method called, the inbound and outbound data. It will also
 * record the approximate time between client invocations, the time used to
 * service the invocation. Subclassing of MonitorItem is allowed; primarily
 * to create self-monitoring classes.
 * <p><i>Note:</i> monitoring an object can be expensive in runtime efficiency.
 * It is best used for debug and performance analysis, during development, or
 * in production, for objects that would not be called very frequently.
