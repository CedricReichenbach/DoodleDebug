/**
 * This class can listen for UDP multicasts over the network, as well
 * as to send out UDP announcements.  The mechanism is <i>rigged</i> to send a
 * reference to a remote object as a zipped MarshalledObject (zedmob).  It also
 * allows a listening object to receive announced object referencess via a
 * callback mechanism. A single VM can use as many Multicast objects as it
 * wishes.
 * <p><i>Note:</i> this class requires that the network routers be configured
 * to pass IP multicast packets, at least for the multicast address used.  If
 * not, the packets will will only exist within the subnet of origination.
