/**
 * This class is used to send server item callbacks to a firewalled client.
 * A client whose firewall settings prohibit incoming socket connections is a
 * common problem. This class is called ClientProxy, as it is a stand-in
 * representation of a remote reference to a client, behind a firewall. This
 * allows server objects to be designed without regard to client firewall
 * issues. An intermediary process would give the server item a real remote
 * reference to the client object when there is no client firewall, or a
 * ClientProxy when there is. The client links the remote reference to this
 * ClientProxy, to the locally firewalled client, using an {@link ItemProxy
 * ItemProxy} object. The server item invokes methods on this client proxy
 * which result in an immediate callback invocation on the client. <p>
 * Instances of ClientProxy can in turn be passed into a
 * {@link TransparentItemProxy TransparentItemProxy} via its get method,
 * to a address the firewalled client by interface. (either synchronously
 * <i>or</i> asynchronously)<p>
 * <i>Note:</i> this paradigm is <u>not</u> threadsafe! It is expected that
 * callbacks to the remote client will <i>not</i> be invoked reentrantly.
 * Correspondingly, a unique instance of this object must be given to each
 * remote client object. A practical usage <a href=http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Communications/FirewalledClients>
 * example</a> is available online.
