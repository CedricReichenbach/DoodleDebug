/**
 * This class is used to transfer its internal proxy object as a zipped
 * marshalled object (zedmob). It will decompress the proxy automatically on
 * arrival at the client. This will incur a small runtime penalty, however, if
 * the proxy is large and highly compressable, or the data link is slow, or the
 * cost per byte to transmit data is high, this can become highly advantageous.
 * The proxy is serialized and compressed once the server reference is
 * provided to it by the {@link ItemServer ItemServer} during the binding of
 * its server object. After that it can no longer be modified at the server.<p>
 * If the server loads proxies into its runtime, i.e. it is not using a
 * {@link ProxyLoader ProxyLoader}, it is <i>highly recommended</i>  to use
 *  zipped proxies, since processor horsepower is increaseing steadily, while
 * long-haul network bandwidth is not.<p>
 * The class is not final; this allows subclasses to have no-arg constructors,
 * using a proxy of their choosing.  Also, a subclass could optionally
 * encrypt the payload before sending, and decrypt it on arrival, if necessary.
