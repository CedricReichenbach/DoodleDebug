~ DoodleDebug 2 ~
=================

Technical
---------

CLEAN UP
- Move to a new git repo (2GB is enough)
- Simplify project setup: 3 plugins can be vanished and be included as a simple jar

Functionality
-------------

CLEAN UP API
Providing user plugins to DD is pretty confusing right now, especially if it's only one.
- Maybe just add methods (like "DoodleDebug.addPlugin(RenderingPlugin)") for single plugins

CLUSTERED LOGGING
- Think of a useful format for logged DD output
- Mechanism to send data to logging instance (without server or localhost?)
- Distinguish between logging and direct output format? Avoid lightboxes for logging?

DOODLE DIFFS
If the same object is doodled multiple times, show some kind of diff information.
- How to calculate diff? Based on raw HTML code?
- How to display diff?
 - Yellow border/shadow/overlay for changed HTML elements
 - Green for new ones
 - Red as a placeholder where a deleted part was
